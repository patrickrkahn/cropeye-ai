Smart Farming Drone AI

Revolutionizing Durian Farming with AI-Powered Drones

Welcome to Smart Farming Drone AI, an open-source project designed to enhance precision agriculture through AI-powered aerial analysis. This system was developed and deployed on a durian farm in the Philippines, leveraging NVIDIA Jetson technology for real-time weed and disease detection.

Using machine learning and edge computing, our Jetson-equipped drone scans orchards, detecting crop health issues on the fly, reducing reliance on manual inspections, and improving farm productivity.

Why Smart Farming for Durian Orchards?

🌳 Durian Farming Challenges

Dense Canopy Cover – Traditional inspections are slow and inefficient.

Tropical Climate Risks – High humidity accelerates fungal infections and pest spread.

Precision Agriculture Demand – Targeted interventions reduce costs and increase fruit quality.

🚁 Our AI-Powered Solution

✅ Onboard Jetson AI Inference – Processes images in real-time directly on the drone.✅ Weed & Disease Detection – Identifies dry patches, fungal infections, and invasive weeds.✅ Edge Computing with Jetson – No internet required, perfect for remote farms.✅ Live Alerts & GPS Tagging – Pinpoints affected areas for quick intervention.✅ Customizable AI Models – Supports YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and segmentation models.✅ Scalable Open-Source Platform – Fork, customize, and deploy worldwide.

How It Works

📍 1. Drone Deployment

A Jetson-powered drone captures aerial footage over the farm.

🔍 2. AI-Based Detection

Onboard NVIDIA Jetson processes images in real-time, detecting weeds, diseases, and soil conditions.

📊 3. Real-Time Insights & GPS Tagging

Results are overlaid on the video feed and flagged with GPS coordinates.

💡 4. Actionable Data for Farmers

Immediate alerts help optimize interventions, from fungicide application to weed removal.

Technology Stack

🔹 NVIDIA Jetson (Edge AI Processing) – Runs AI models directly on the drone.🔹 CUDA & TensorRT – Optimizes inference speed and efficiency.🔹 DeepStream SDK (Optional) – Multi-stream analytics for larger farm operations.🔹 PyTorch + YOLOv8 – Object detection models for identifying crop health issues.

Case Study: Deployment in a Durian Orchard

📍 Location: Durian Farm, Philippines

🔎 Objective: Detect fungal diseases and weed encroachment

🛠️ Setup:

Drone equipped with NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

YOLOv8 trained on durian-specific datasets.

Edge inference deployed, reducing reliance on cloud computing.

🚀 Results:

✅ Faster Inspections – Reduced manual scouting time by 75%.✅ Targeted Interventions – Less pesticide use, saving costs.✅ Increased Yield – Early disease detection prevented fruit loss.

"This system helped us detect leaf infections before they spread—saving our orchard thousands in potential losses." – Durian Farmer, Philippines
