Drone Flight: An autonomous or piloted drone covers the orchard.
NVIDIA Jetson: Receives the video feed, runs object detection or segmentation to identify weeds, diseases, or dry patches.
Alerts/Output: Live bounding boxes or segmented areas indicate where urgent action is needed (e.g., spraying fungicide).
Local Dashboard: Results are stored locally or relayed to a farmer’s mobile device for immediate insight, even without internet coverage.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-farming-drone-imaging.git
cd smart-farming-drone-imaging
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Default includes torch, torchvision, opencv-python, and ultralytics.
For Jetson devices, install the Jetson-compatible versions of PyTorch and OpenCV, and optionally TensorRT if you want further optimization.
Run a Demo (Locally or on Jetson)

Streamlit Demo (if you have a GUI environment or if you’re on a laptop/desktop):
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Command-Line:
bash
Copy
Edit
python smart_farming.py --source mock_farm_video.mp4
On Jetson, ensure you’ve installed the correct wheel files for PyTorch, TorchVision, etc., before running.
Train or Fine-Tune

Create a dataset of durian orchard images (label weeds, disease-affected leaves, or other anomalies).
Fine-tune YOLO or a chosen model on your custom dataset:
bash
Copy
Edit
yolo train data=durian_farm.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50
Convert or optimize for TensorRT:
bash
Copy
Edit
yolo export model=best.pt format=tensorrt
Example Workflow on a Philippine Durian Farm
Drone Pre-Flight: Ensure Jetson is powered, the detection model is loaded, and the battery is fully charged.
Aerial Survey: Fly over the orchard in a grid pattern, capturing top-down views of durian trees.
On-the-Fly Detection: NVIDIA Jetson processes each frame. If a suspicious patch is detected (e.g., leaf discoloration or a cluster of weeds), the location is flagged via GPS coordinates.
Immediate Action: Farmers or farmworkers can be alerted in near real-time, applying fungicide to affected areas or removing weeds quickly.
Data Review: After flight, a local or cloud-based dashboard aggregates results, building a historical record of orchard health over time.
