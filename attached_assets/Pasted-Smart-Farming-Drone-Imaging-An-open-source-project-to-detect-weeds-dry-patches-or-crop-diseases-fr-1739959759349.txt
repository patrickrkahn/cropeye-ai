Smart Farming Drone Imaging
An open-source project to detect weeds, dry patches, or crop diseases from aerial drone footage using NVIDIA GPU acceleration.
Special Focus: Durian Farm Deployment in the Philippines with NVIDIA Jetson

Overview
Durian farming in the Philippines has unique challenges—large orchard tracts, dense canopies, and a tropical climate ripe for fungal diseases and pests. Smart Farming Drone Imaging harnesses the power of computer vision to pinpoint issues in real-time and assist local growers in maximizing yield and fruit quality.

By leveraging NVIDIA GPU technologies—particularly NVIDIA Jetson devices for on-drone edge processing—this project aims to minimize costly delays in identifying problem areas. Our approach is open-source, enabling farmers, researchers, and developers to collaborate, adapt it for local conditions, and continually improve model performance.

Key Features
Real-Time Durian Orchard Scans: Process aerial footage in-flight to detect early signs of leaf discoloration, fungal diseases, or weed encroachment.
Edge Deployment with Jetson: Reduce bandwidth and power consumption by running inference directly on an NVIDIA Jetson-equipped drone.
Modular Architecture: Swap YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or segmentation models based on the specific farming need.
Scalable & Extensible: Integrate additional sensors (e.g., thermal, multispectral) to further refine detection.
Open-Source Collaboration: Fork, modify, and share improvements for broader adoption in Southeast Asian agriculture and beyond.
Why Durian Farms in the Philippines?
High-Value Crop: Durians are highly prized in local and international markets. Early detection of diseases or pests can significantly increase yield and profit.
Tropical Climate Challenges: Warm, humid conditions promote rapid disease spread. Quick, targeted interventions are critical.
Hard-to-Reach Canopies: Durian trees can grow tall and dense, making ground inspections difficult. Drones offer a practical overhead view.
Jetson Edge Inference: Many durian farms lack stable internet connections. Running GPU-accelerated models on the drone or near the field avoids cloud dependencies.
NVIDIA Technology Stack
NVIDIA Jetson (Edge Deployment)
A powerful, compact computing platform ideal for in-field AI inference, reducing latency and reliance on internet connectivity.
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
Parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs accelerates both training (in the lab) and inference (in the field).
TensorRT (Optional)
Optimize your trained models for the Jetson environment, achieving higher frames-per-second with lower latency.
DeepStream (Optional for Multi-Stream Analytics)
Particularly useful if you have multiple drones or camera feeds for larger orchard operations.

  [ Local Storage / User Dashboard ]
Drone Flight: An autonomous or piloted drone covers the orchard.
NVIDIA Jetson: Receives the video feed, runs object detection or segmentation to identify weeds, diseases, or dry patches.
Alerts/Output: Live bounding boxes or segmented areas indicate where urgent action is needed (e.g., spraying fungicide).
Local Dashboard: Results are stored locally or relayed to a farmer’s mobile device for immediate insight, even without internet coverage.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-farming-drone-imaging.git
cd smart-farming-drone-imaging
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Default includes torch, torchvision, opencv-python, and ultralytics.
For Jetson devices, install the Jetson-compatible versions of PyTorch and OpenCV, and optionally TensorRT if you want further optimization.
Run a Demo (Locally or on Jetson)

Streamlit Demo (if you have a GUI environment or if you’re on a laptop/desktop):
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Command-Line:
bash
Copy
Edit
python smart_farming.py --source mock_farm_video.mp4
On Jetson, ensure you’ve installed the correct wheel files for PyTorch, TorchVision, etc., before running.
Train or Fine-Tune

Create a dataset of durian orchard images (label weeds, disease-affected leaves, or other anomalies).
Fine-tune YOLO or a chosen model on your custom dataset:
bash
Copy
Edit
yolo train data=durian_farm.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50
Convert or optimize for TensorRT:
bash
Copy
Edit
yolo export model=best.pt format=tensorrt
Example Workflow on a Philippine Durian Farm
Drone Pre-Flight: Ensure Jetson is powered, the detection model is loaded, and the battery is fully charged.
Aerial Survey: Fly over the orchard in a grid pattern, capturing top-down views of durian trees.
On-the-Fly Detection: NVIDIA Jetson processes each frame. If a suspicious patch is detected (e.g., leaf discoloration or a cluster of weeds), the location is flagged via GPS coordinates.
Immediate Action: Farmers or farmworkers can be alerted in near real-time, applying fungicide to affected areas or removing weeds quickly.
Data Review: After flight, a local or cloud-based dashboard aggregates results, building a historical record of orchard health over time.
