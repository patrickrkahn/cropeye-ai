CropEye AI

Empowering Farmers with AI-Driven Drones

Welcome to CropEye AI, an open-source project designed to bring precision agriculture to life through AI-powered aerial analysis. We run a durian farm in the Southern Philippines, and we leveraged NVIDIA Jetson, CUDA, and YOLO to detect weeds and crop diseases in real-time‚Äîall from a drone. Now, we're excited to share our work with the world!

Why CropEye?

Real-Time Detection: Catch issues early‚Äîlike weeds, fungal infections, and dry patches‚Äîusing a Jetson-equipped drone.

Reduced Labor: Automated aerial scans cut down on manual inspections, saving both time and resources.

Sustainable Practices: Targeted treatments help reduce excessive use of chemicals, preserving soil quality and boosting yield.

Open-Source Collaboration: Adapt and improve the system to suit different farms and crops.

Key Features

On-Drone Inference (NVIDIA Jetson): Run computer vision models directly on the drone for immediate results.

AI-Powered Weed & Disease Detection: Uses YOLO (or your choice of object detection/segmentation frameworks) for quick analysis.

Edge Computing: No need for constant internet access‚Äîperfect for remote farms.

GPS Tagging & Alerts: Automatically mark and track problem areas for targeted interventions.

Scalable & Modular: Easily tailor or expand the code for other crops or orchard types.

How It Works

Drone Flight: Launch the CropEye AI drone over your orchard.

Real-Time Analysis: The drone's NVIDIA Jetson processes camera feeds instantly, detecting weeds, disease symptoms, or stressed soil.

Alerts & Overlays: Results are overlaid onto the live feed with bounding boxes, plus GPS coordinates for precise targeting.

Review & Action: Farm staff can immediately review flagged areas and plan interventions‚Äîspraying fungicide, removing weeds, etc.

Deployment on a Durian Farm

Location: Southern Philippines

Objectives: Early fungal detection, weed control, and overall orchard health monitoring.

Setup:

Drone with NVIDIA Jetson module

YOLO-based detection model

Edge inference for real-time bounding boxes

Outcome:

Reduced Manual Scouting: Quicker, more frequent scans of the orchard.

Targeted Chemical Use: Apply fungicides or herbicides exactly where needed.

Healthier Trees & Higher Yields: Early detection prevents disease spread and fruit loss.

Quick Start

Clone & Install:

git clone https://github.com/patrickrkahn/smart-farming-drone-ai.git
cd smart-farming-drone-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Demo:

Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py

CLI:

python smart_farming.py --source sample_farm_video.mp4

Train a Custom Model:

yolo train data=durian_farm.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50

Optimize for Jetson:

yolo export model=best.pt format=tensorrt
