    # Overview
    st.markdown("""
    ### Overview
    Durian farming in the Philippines has unique challenges‚Äîlarge orchard tracts, dense canopies, 
    and a tropical climate ripe for fungal diseases and pests. Smart Farming Drone Imaging harnesses 
    the power of computer vision to pinpoint issues in real-time and assist local growers in maximizing 
    yield and fruit quality.

    By leveraging NVIDIA GPU technologies‚Äîparticularly NVIDIA Jetson devices for on-drone edge processing‚Äîthis 
    project aims to minimize costly delays in identifying problem areas. Our approach is open-source, enabling 
    farmers, researchers, and developers to collaborate, adapt it for local conditions, and continually 
    improve model performance.

    # Key Features
    st.markdown("""
    ### Key Features
    - **Real-Time Durian Orchard Scans**: Process aerial footage in-flight to detect early signs of leaf 
      discoloration, fungal diseases, or weed encroachment.
    - **Edge Deployment with Jetson**: Reduce bandwidth and power consumption by running inference directly 
      on an NVIDIA Jetson-equipped drone.
    - **Modular Architecture**: Swap YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or segmentation models based on the specific farming need.
    - **Scalable & Extensible**: Integrate additional sensors (e.g., thermal, multispectral) to further refine detection.
    - **Open-Source Collaboration**: Fork, modify, and share improvements for broader adoption in Southeast Asian 
      agriculture and beyond.

    # Technology Stack
    st.markdown("""
    ### NVIDIA Technology Stack
    - **NVIDIA Jetson (Edge Deployment)**: A powerful, compact computing platform ideal for in-field AI inference, 
      reducing latency and reliance on internet connectivity.
    - **CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)**: Parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs accelerates both training 
      (in the lab) and inference (in the field).
    - **TensorRT (Optional)**: Optimize your trained models for the Jetson environment, achieving higher 
      frames-per-second with lower latency.
    - **DeepStream (Optional for Multi-Stream Analytics)**: Particularly useful if you have multiple drones or 
      camera feeds for larger orchard operations.
    """)

    # Future Enhancements
    st.markdown("""
    ### Future Enhancements
    - **Disease Segmentation**: Move beyond bounding boxes to precisely delineate infected leaf regions for 
      more accurate fungicide targeting.
    - **Multi-Drone Coordination**: If you have several Jetson-powered drones, share flight data in real-time 
      for larger orchard coverage.
    - **Offline Data Analysis**: Sync orchard health metrics to a local server or cloud when internet is 
      available, enabling advanced analytics.
    - **Integration with Other Sensors**: Merge data from infrared, thermal, or hyperspectral cameras to 
      detect stress levels and water deficiencies.
