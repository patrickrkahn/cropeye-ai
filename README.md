# Smart Farming Drone Imaging

A Python-based application for analyzing drone footage to detect objects (simulating weed/crop detection) using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how computer vision can be applied to agricultural drone footage for detecting objects of interest. While the demo uses YOLO's default classes, the same principle can be applied to detect weeds, unhealthy crops, or other agricultural features with a custom-trained model.

## Prerequisites

The following Python packages are required:
- opencv-python
- ultralytics
- torch
- numpy

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
